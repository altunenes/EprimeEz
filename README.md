Tidying and Summarizing E-Prime outputs...

Suppose we have a output file like below:

This is a common E-Prime 3.0  (which is the most popular experimental software among psychologists) output. It has 1000+ rows and as you can see, it's a raw file which means there is no average or correct ratio for each participant it has only raw scores. Our goal is the tidy this raw data and preparing it to suitable for analyzing process. (and much more readable of course). 


(And sometimes your professor may want this file as CSV output)
